This is an ETL pipleline automated with airflow.

The aim is:
  1- gathering data from a warehouse system managemnt in Json format,
  2- clean it 
  3- and then load the transformed data to a on-prem database. 
  
This task needs to be done again and agian every day. therefore, airflow is used to orchestrate it.

Here are two useful links to helop you set up the airflow on your system. Then by running the Dag.py code you can see how the pipline works. at the end if the piplene successfully ends, a new CSV file appears on your download folder.
